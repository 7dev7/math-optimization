### Implementation of methods for finding the extremum of a strictly unimodal function
1. [Golden-section search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden-section_search).
The technique derives its name from the fact that the algorithm maintains the function values for triples of points whose distances form a golden ratio
2. [Newton's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method).
is a method for finding successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function.
